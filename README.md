# Laptop Price Prediction

This repository contains the project for predicting laptop prices based on various features. The main tool used for this project is a Jupyter Notebook that includes data exploration, processing, and model training.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the price of laptops based on their specifications and features. The dataset used for this project includes attributes such as graphic card type, CPU cores, RAM size, operating system, drive type, screen size, and more.

## Repository Contents

- `Regression-Project-LaptopPricePrediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, processing, and model training.

## Data

The dataset includes the following features:
- `graphic card type`
- `communications`
- `resolution (px)`
- `CPU cores`
- `RAM size`
- `operating system`
- `drive type`
- `input devices`
- `multimedia`
- `RAM type`
- `CPU clock speed (GHz)`
- `CPU model`
- `state`
- `drive memory size (GB)`
- `warranty`
- `screen size`
- `buynow_price`

### Data Processing

The notebook includes steps for:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Concatenating training, validation, and test sets
3. Exploring the data structure and types
4. Preprocessing and cleaning the data

### Model Training

The project includes training a regression model to predict laptop prices. The model evaluation metrics and techniques are detailed in the notebook.

## Usage

To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the necessary Python libraries. The main libraries used are:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
