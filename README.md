Laptop Price Prediction
This repository contains the project for predicting laptop prices based on various features. The main tool used for this project is a Jupyter Notebook that includes data exploration, processing, and model training.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the price of laptops based on their specifications and features. The dataset used for this project includes attributes such as graphic card type, CPU cores, RAM size, operating system, drive type, screen size, and more.
